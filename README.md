# openligadb

DESCRIPTION
I chose Javascript, JSON, jQuery, Bootstrap and HTML to develop this website, because they are technologies for web apps and very easy to code. The workflow is simple. When browser loads the openligadb.html, the JSON containing matches is retrieved via Ajax. After this, the page prepare the data and build the GUI using HTML and Bootstrap.

INSTALL
No installation is required.

EXECUTE
Open the file openligadb.html in a browser. I suggest Google Chrome.
